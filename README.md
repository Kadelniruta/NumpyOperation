NumPy Operations: A Demonstrative Guide
This notebook demonstrates fundamental NumPy functionalities through a series of examples. Below is a breakdown of the operations performed:

1. Array Creation and Basic Operations
1D Array Creation: Created a 1D array of numbers from 1 to 100.
Reshaping: Reshaped the 1D array into a 10x10 matrix.
Matrix Operations: Calculated the sum, mean, and standard deviation of the entire matrix, along with the row-wise and column-wise sums.
2. Boolean Indexing
Random Array Generation: Created a NumPy array with random integers from 1 to 50.
Divisibility by 5: Extracted numbers divisible by 5.
Replacement of Even Numbers: Replaced all even numbers with 0.
Count Greater Than 25: Counted how many numbers in the array were greater than 25.
3. Linear Algebra Operations
Matrix Multiplication: Generated two random 3x3 matrices and performed matrix multiplication.
Element-wise Multiplication: Multiplied the matrices element-wise.
Determinant and Inverse: Calculated the determinant and checked for invertibility of each matrix.
4. Symmetric Matrix and Eigenvalues
Created a symmetric 4x4 matrix.
Computed eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Verified matrix reconstruction using the eigenvalue decomposition.
5. Data Transformation
Transformed a 1D array into a 2D array by repeating each element along a new axis.
